# Matrix-Inversion

Final Project for High Performance and Parallel Computing.

Investigates how quickly Matrix Inversion can be accomplished using the Gauss Jordan method with the following:

    - Intel SIMD (AVX-512 Instruction Set)
    - OpenMP
    - CUDA
  
We also ran the program serially on the CPU.

The results can be seen below:
